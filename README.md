# TMTool

A simple GUI utility that provides additional workflows for Microsoft's Threat Modeling Tool. This project aims to assist both template developers and model makers.

## Installation

```
$ pip install TMTool
```

## Usage

```
$ TMTool
```



## Project Goals:

 - For template design, this project hopes to address some of the complexities that come with managing a “database” of threats and stencils. For modeling, this project experiments with extracting metrics from our model and improving how Threat Modeling fits within DevOps/SDLC.

 - Improve upon Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool's workflow by providing a simple interface of supplemental workflows (See: /TMTool/Scripts)

    - To be used in conjunction with Microsoft's Tool
    - It's NOT a goal of this project to create the "perfect" threat model/model template. There are plenty of other projects for templates and threat databases.

 - Explore automating/semi-automating threat analysis, risk assessments, security assessments, or impact analysis, tracing to compliance standards, etc. from model metrics.

    - metrics inferred from a collection of stencil properties, threat properties, or model notes

 - make mass edits to threat logic or any other threat/stencil properties within a template

 - explore how threat modeling can best fit within the dev-ops life cycle
