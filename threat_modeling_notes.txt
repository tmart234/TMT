*A collection of my thoughts on different parts of the threat modeling process*

goal: to utilize TMT's built-in reporting and threat auditing features but with more usability (scoring)

2 Scripts for diffing:
- diff template produced .csv files (produced in template2csv.py script) for template devs to compare and possibly to partially integrate new threats into their template. Categories: Major: missing stencils, flows, or threats entirely Minor: modified threat definition, modified threat logic, modified flow & stencil properties
- diff the TMT produced csv files, regardless of TMTâ€™s numbering or the ordering (unsorted), to compare


Modeling
- a model's Note entries are system level, not threat ID level like how threat properties are.
	- therefore model notes could contain system metadata for scripts and other variables that shouldn't change. 
	- ex: CVSS environmental metrics like Security Requirements (based on risk level) or the Target Distribution (proportion of vulnerable systems)

Auditing a Model's Threats
- "Export to CSV" function will only grab threat IDs and their threat properties
	- using the exported csv allong with the model.csv (produced from model2csv.py script), we can begin to automatically audit threats
- when auditing the generated threat IDs, if a False positive is identified, set status to: "not applicable"
- Justification column should hold justification for the severity level, CIA, or why it's a flase positive
	- Justification should not be for mitigations

Reporting
- address how can we view access vector (an element property) within the generated threat model report?
- address how can we view authentication (an element property) within the generated threat model report?
 
Python scoring script
- ditch access complexity completely? or cange to just a high/low scores (remove medium AC score like in CVSS 3.0)? Need to decide
- CVSS base metrics + environmental metrics?
- authentication could be baked into the model
- CVSS will have threashold and threat's CVSS score mapped to the threat's "priority" in Threat properties?
	- set the "CVSS Score" threat property for each threat ID
	- below threashold will automatically set status to: Not Aplicable
	- above, set status to: Needs Investigation and set "priority"
	- explore adding more statuses to template? is this needed?
