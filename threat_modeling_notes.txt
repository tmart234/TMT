 *A collection of my thoughts on different parts of the threat modeling process*

Project Goals:
	- improve and automate upon the overall process of threat modeling while provide supplemental scripts for the threat modeling process for where TMT misses the mark
		- It is NOT a goal of this project to create the "perfect" threat model or model template. "Perfect is the enemy of good"
	- infer threat and model metrics from element properties, threat properties, or model notes. (See model2csv.py)
	- explore scoring derived threats within TMT's analysis mode (metrics as threat properties)
	- explore feeding report into JIRA
	- make it easier for template developers to manage a threat database and make mass edits to a template's elements, guids, threats, threat logic, etc.
	Future goals:
	- explore auditing models based on compliance standards
	- explore writing and verifying "test models" to check that threats are/aren't being derived by a template

The typical TM process:
Scope -> Model -> Analyze - Mitigate -> Document

Future diffing scripts:
- diff template produced .csv files (produced in template2csv.py script) for template developers to compare and possibly to partially integrate new threats into their template. Categories: Major: missing stencils, flows, or threats entirely Minor: modified threat definition, modified threat logic, modified flow & stencil properties
	- diffing template functionality can almost entirely be pulled from csv2template.py
- diff the TMT produced csv files, regardless of TMTâ€™s numbering or the ordering (unsorted)

Modeling:
- a model's Note entries are system level, not threat ID level like Threat Properties (which can be set for every generated threat)
	- therefore model notes could contain system metadata for scripts and other variables that shouldn't change. 
		- ex: CVSS environmental metrics like Security Requirements (based on risk level) or the Target Distribution (proportion of vulnerable systems)

Analyzing & Auditing:
- utilize TMT's built-in Analysis as much as possible
- "Export to CSV" function will only grab threat IDs and their threat properties
	- using the exported csv along with the model.csv (produced from model2csv.py script), we can begin to automatically audit threats
- when auditing the generated threat IDs, if a False positive is identified, set status to: "not applicable"
- set CIA & severity (custom template threat properties) when analyzing
 
Python scoring script
- Use CVSS base metrics + environmental metrics? This seems easier to use than other things like OWASP Risk rating methodology: https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology
- Explore ditching CVSS base + environmental in favor of a simpler Probability * Impact ranking system
	- pro : consists of just 2 metrics Probability & Impact
		- low (5), medium (10), high (15) 
	- con: both Probability & Impact can't be inferred without adding more built-in metrics or explicitly setting via scoring each threat.
- could and should authentication be represented in the template more than just flow element properties?
- CVSS will have score threshold. The threat's CVSS score can be mapped to the threat's "priority" level in Threat properties? (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool-feature-overview#priority-change)
	Workflow:
	- make sure threats are ready to score after the analyzing stage
	- score threats
	- script sets the "CVSS Score" threat property for each threat
	- below threshold scores will automatically set status to: Not Applicable with a generic justification
	- above threshold scores, set status to: Needs Investigation and set "priority" level
	- maybe add statuses to template like: Scored (indicates analysis was done: CIA, severity, and other threat props are set)

	
Documenting
- utilize TMT's built-in reporting as much as possible:
- address how can we view access vector (an element property) within the generated threat model report?
- address how can we view authentication (an element property) within the generated threat model report?
	- script that fills in an empty Threat Property after finding or not finding the element property required (ex: [flow] has Auth is 'Yes')
	
Template
- Answers: "what are we building?" and "what could go wrong?"
- in test_template.tm7, we've added the following as Threat Properties: C.I.A. metrics (CVSS base), Access complexity (base), severity (environmental), CVSS overall score, and HTML Compliance Tags
	- asses if we should pre-set Access Complexity and Severity threat properties within our threat database
	- PyTM has a good database of threats that could be part of any template: https://github.com/izar/pytm/blob/master/docs/threats.md
		- contains metrics: Severity, Mitigations, conditional logic (will have to be modified) & pre-requirements, and links to CAPEC and CWE HTML compliance tags
- explore pre-setting Access Complexity in our template/threat database
- Address and explore how templates and/or threat databases can provide different data-flow diagram depth layers: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/tm-provide-context-with-the-right-depth-layer/
	- Layer 0: major system parts. Layer 1: secondary system parts. Layer 2: system's sub-components. Layer 3: every process and low-level system subpart

Mitigations
- Answers: "what are we going to do about it?"
- Microsoft has a decent list of mitigations
	- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool-mitigations
	- unfortunately these mitigations are not baked into the TMT in a sensible way where we can derive them
	- maybe we can categorize this mitigation list further based on STRIDE's desired properties
		- Workflow: generate a threat -> look up STRIDE desired property -> derive mitigation Class -> implementation of mitigation/ device security requirements (TMT shouldn't derive, but should give basic suggestions on how)
- will need to answer the final question after settling on a mitigation: "did we do a good enough job?". We can address that answer in Threat's Justification section. would imply a second analysis after deciding on a mitigation
